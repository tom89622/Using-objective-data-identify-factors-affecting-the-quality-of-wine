# Using-objective-data-identify-factors-affecting-the-quality-of-wine
The project Using objective data to identify factors affecting the quality of wine focuses on concluding factors influencing the quality of white and red wine. We fetch the data set from Kaggle. In data processing, we suggest that the quality of a wine is subjective, and an absolute value makes the result too similar. Therefore, we transfer each attribute into 1 and -1 by executing the maximum minus the median and then dividing the median. In the end, we utilize Apriori to find a frequent set. In the result of white wine, we conclude that the attribute of alcohol affects quality when it attains a value of 1, but not when it's -1. In contrast, for red wine, the attribute of alcohol significantly influences the quality. That is to say, when the alcohol is 1, the value of quality is high, and lower quality when the alcohol is -1. I took charge of all the parts of the code implementation. Also, I took part in the discussion of designing methods and concluding results.
